## Overview

Reviving my 40-year-old game.  Originally published in
[Compute! magazine in 1984](https://archive.org/details/1984-02-compute-magazine/page/n63/mode/2up),
the code originally targeted the Commodore VIC-20 and 64. 

**C64 version now playable [online](https://www.setera.org/assets/compute-circus/)!**
